# Entropy-Based Ranking Method Explanation

The method introduces several key innovations for ensemble selection:

1. **Multi-Metric Diversity Assessment**
- Uses four complementary diversity measures:
  - Disagreement: Simple mismatch between classifiers
  - Correlation: Linear dependency between predictions
  - Q-statistic: Tendency to make coincident errors
  - Double-fault: Joint failure rate

2. **Entropy-Based Weight Adaptation**
- Weights for diversity metrics are dynamically adjusted based on the entropy of predictions
- Higher entropy (more uncertainty) → more weight to complex measures
- Lower entropy (more certainty) → more weight to simple measures

3. **Ensemble Member Selection**
- Uses a greedy selection algorithm with adaptive diversity-confidence trade-off
- Starts with the most confident classifier
- Iteratively adds members that maximize both diversity and confidence

## Algorithm Steps

1. **Entropy Calculation**
- For each classifier, we calculate the entropy of its predictions
- High entropy indicates uncertain/diverse predictions
- Low entropy indicates more consistent predictions
- This helps adapt the importance of different diversity measures

1. **Diversity Measures**
Using classifiers T1 and T2 as an example:
```
T1: [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
T2: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
```

The method calculates:
- Disagreement: Proportion of instances where predictions differ
- Correlation: Linear dependency between predictions
- Q-statistic: Based on contingency table of agreements/disagreements
- Double-fault: Proportion of instances where both classifiers fail

3. **Adaptive Weighting**
If the average entropy is high (close to 1):
- More weight to complex measures (correlation, Q-statistic)
- Less weight to simple measures (disagreement)

If the entropy is low (close to 0):
- More weight to simple measures
- Less weight to complex measures

4. **Ensemble Selection**
For each potential ensemble member:
- Calculate weighted diversity with current ensemble
- Consider confidence scores
- Use adaptive weight (α):
  ```python
  score = α * diversity_score + (1 - α) * confidence_score
  ```
  where α decreases as ensemble grows

5. **Final Prediction**
- Uses weighted voting based on confidence scores
- Higher confidence classifiers have more influence on final prediction

The key advantage of this method is its adaptability:
- Automatically adjusts to data complexity
- Balances diversity and confidence
- Prevents redundant classifier selection
- Maintains prediction quality with smaller ensembles
